# Alien-Invasion from Eric Matthes Python Crash Course book.
# Needs Pygame installed to run 
# works best on smaller screens
# Basic game functionality:
#           Arrows for left right direction
#           spacebar to shoot
#           q to quit... I think 
#
#
# I learned about modularity, classes, OOP and many great things from this game and Eric's book
